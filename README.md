# SendGrid Event Webhook Starter Kit

The SendGrid Event Webhook Starter Kit (or "Event Kit") is an open source project for quickly setting up your web server with an endpoint for SendGrid's Event Webhook and provides an interface to view and search your stored events.

# System Requirements

- PHP 5.3 or higher
- SQLite 3 or higher

# Quick Installation

If you just wish to install the project on your web server, you can do so by following the steps below:

**Step 1 - Download The Installer**

First, download the installer file by [clicking here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sendgrid/eventkit/master/quick_installer/index.php.zip).

**Step 2 - Upload the Installer**

Unzip the file and copy the index.php file to your web server (wherever you place it on your web server is where you'll be viewing the application).

**Step 3 - Visit The File In Your Web Browser**

Visit wherever you uploaded the file in your web browser.  The installer will start downloading all the necessary files and present you with a setup guide to get the endpoint going.  The application will also configure your SendGrid account to start sending notifications to your new endpoint.

**Step 4 - Profit**

After that you should be all set! You can revisit your endpoint at any time to view your events or search.
